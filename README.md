Overview: Inventory Management System
The Inventory Management System is a Python-based application designed to manage inventory for stores, warehouses, or small businesses. 
It provides an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) powered by the Tkinter library, offering a user-friendly experience for tracking and managing products.
The system is ideal for businesses looking for an offline solution to maintain and monitor inventory efficiently.

User Authentication
Secure login functionality to restrict access to authorized personnel.
Default credentials for demonstration:
Username: admin
Password: password123

Key Features:

*Product Management:

Add new products with details such as ID, Name, Quantity, and Price.
Edit existing product details to update inventory or correct errors.
Delete products no longer in stock.

*Real-Time Inventory Tracking:

View all products in a table format with columns for Product ID, Name, Quantity, and Price.
Track inventory levels and monitor low-stock products.

*Reports:
Generate Low Stock Reports to identify products below a specified quantity threshold (e.g., less than 5).
Summary displays actionable data for inventory management.
Data Validation

Prevent duplicate product IDs.
Validate numerical inputs for quantity and price fields.

*Graphical User Interface (GUI):

Modern and clean interface built using Tkinter.
Easy navigation with buttons for key actions (e.g., Add, Edit, Delete, Report).
Preloaded Inventory (Demo)
The system comes with a set of preloaded products for demonstration purposes. This allows users to test functionalities like adding, editing, deleting, and generating reports without entering data manually.
Example preloaded data:
Product ID	Name	Quantity	Price
P001  Laptop	1	 35000
P002	printer 1  5000
P003	speaker 1  3999

*How to Run:

Clone or download the repository from GitHub.
Install Python (if not already installed).
Run the script using:
bash
Copy code
python inventory_management.py

*Login using the default credentials:

Username: admin
Password: password123
Use the GUI to manage your inventory.

*Technology tools used:
Technologies Used:

Python 3.11.1
Tkinter / PyQt (for GUI)
SQLite / MySQL (for database)
Pandas (for data manipulation and reporting)
Bcrypt (for password hashing and secure authentication)

*Future Enhancements:

Barcode Scanner Integration for faster product entry.
Sales Module to track purchases directly.

Cloud Integration for remote access to inventory data.

Mobile App Extension to manage inventory on the go.
